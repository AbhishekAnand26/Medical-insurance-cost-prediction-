Problem Statement
As a Machine Learning (ML) Expert or Data Scientist (DS), the goal is to build an automated system that can accurately predict the medical insurance cost for an individual. A medical insurance company requires a solution that can learn from the data of their customers and predict the insurance cost based on a variety of factors such as health issues, gender, age, and other personal attributes.

Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict medical insurance costs, helping insurance companies to estimate premiums based on a customer’s health-related data.

Workflow
Data Collection
The dataset used in this project contains information such as the insured individual's age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region, alongside the insurance charges. These features influence the cost of medical insurance.

Data Analysis
The collected data is explored through various data visualization techniques to understand the relationships between features. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps uncover insights and patterns within the dataset that may influence the insurance costs.

Data Preprocessing
Before feeding the data into the ML model, it is essential to preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and performing feature selection. This step ensures the data is clean and ready for model training.

Train-Test Split
The dataset is split into training and testing subsets. The training data is used to train the machine learning model, while the test data is used to evaluate the model's performance and generalization ability.

Linear Regression Model
A Linear Regression model is employed to predict the insurance cost. This algorithm fits a linear equation to the input data to estimate the target variable (insurance cost). After training the model, it is evaluated based on performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.

Prediction on New Data
Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict insurance costs for new data. The system is designed to take in new individual data points and output an estimated insurance cost.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building a machine learning model to predict medical insurance costs. The Linear Regression model provides predictions based on a set of features that influence the insurance premiums. With further tuning and exploration, more advanced models can be tested to improve accuracy.
